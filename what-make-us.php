                            At Compass Counseling, we understand that every student is unique. We go beyond grades and test scores to consider the whole student â€“ their passions, interests, learning styles, and personal goals. Whether your student is just starting their high school journey or navigating the complexities of college applications, we provide personalized guidance and support.
                        </p>

We offer customized plans and flexible pricing options to ensure that our services are accessible to all families. Our goal is to find the best college fit for your student, not just the most selective institution. We focus on identifying colleges that align with your student's academic, social, and financial needs while fostering a sense of purpose and excitement about their future.
