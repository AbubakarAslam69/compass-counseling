                            Finances are a major concern for most families, and I ensure that parents have a realistic
                            understanding of what they can afford without jeopardizing their financial stability or
                            retirement. I know the pressures and anxieties that come with this process, from the stress
                            of determining how to pay for college to the uncertainty of which schools are the best fit.
                            That’s why I work tirelessly to demystify the terminology and complexities, providing clear,
                            actionable advice that comes from my extensive experience in this field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At Compass Counseling, I don’t promise to eliminate the stress entirely, but I do aim to
                            make it manageable. I offer guidance that helps families feel informed and empowered so they
                            can make confident decisions that will benefit their student’s academic journey and
                            long-term career goals.
