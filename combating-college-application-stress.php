                    <p>Applying for college can be somewhat taxing. Deadlines, papers, and the pressure to get into the
                        "right" university may all wear one out.</p>
                    <p>These pointers help you to control stress:</p>
                    <p><strong>Break it down: </strong>Sort the application procedure into reasonable chores.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prioritize self-care: </strong>Make sure you eat well, sleep enough, and work out
                        consistently.</p>
                    <p><strong>Talk to someone: </strong>Don't stuff your emotions. Discuss your worries with a friend,
                        relative, or counselor.</p>
                    <p>Compass Counseling is aware of the pressure college applications bring. We provide conducive
                        surroundings where you can get direction and heard. We will assist in your development of a
