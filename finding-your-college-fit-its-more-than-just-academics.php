                    <p>Selecting a college goes beyond academics. It's about locating where you feel motivated,
                        supported, and
                        comfortable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Consider campus culture:</strong>Do you flourish in a big, busy setting or a small,
                        close-knit
                        community?</p>
                    <p><strong>Explore campus resources:</strong>: Does the college provide tools, groups, and clubs
                        that match
                        your interests?</p>
                    <p><strong>Visit campuses (if possible): </strong>Feel the college environment and see yourself
                        living
                        there.

                        life.
