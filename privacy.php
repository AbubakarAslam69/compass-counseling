                        <p>
                            Compass Counseling follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors
                            when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and are a part of hosting services'
                            analytics. The information collected by log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
                            browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp, referring/exit pages,
                            and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any personally identifiable
                            information. Instead, the information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track
                            users' movement, and gather demographic information.
                        </p>

                            visited. In addition, the information is used to optimize the users' experience by
                            customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and other information.
                        </p>
