                                The college application process was drowning me. Deadlines loomed, essays seemed
                                difficult, and I was beginning to get terrified. I next ran across an agent at Compass
                                Counseling. They were extremely orderly and quiet, instantly enabling me to relax. We
                                developed essay ideas, polished my college list, and even simulated an interview. I
                                finally passed into my dream university! Without Compass Counseling, I couldn't have
                                done it.

                                My son was having great trouble deciding where to apply to college. He had no notion
                                what kind of atmosphere would match him or what he wanted to study. Compass Counseling
                                guided his exploration of interests, college research, and even some campus visits. They
                                invested the time to learn about his personality and locate colleges that would
                                encourage his intellectual and personal development. He is now doing great in a college
                                that fits him exactly.

                            <h4>Making College Affordable</h4>
                            <p>
                                I feared that my family would find college unaffordable. Compass Counseling clarified
                                our alternatives, negotiated the financial aid application process, and investigated
                                scholarship possibilities. They guided us toward wise college expense options and were
                                patient and knowledgeable. Thanks to their direction, my daughter is currently enrolled
                                at a great university, debt-free.
