                    <p>Hey there, upcoming college graduates! Let's discuss some prevalent college application
                        fallacies.</p>
                    <h3>Only perfect grades matter. </h3>
                    <p>Although excellent academics are valued, universities view each student holistically. Essays,
                        extracurricular activities, and overcoming obstacles reveal your character and fortitude.</p>
                    <h3>You need to apply to every Ivy League.</h3>
                    <p>Steer clear of the Ivy League hoopla! Amazing universities that might suit your academic taste
                        and hobbies abound.</p>
                    <h3>You need to have your life figured out.</h3>
                    <p> Most college students at 17 are unsure of exactly what they want to do with their lives. That's
                        all right. One's time at college is for development and discovery.</p>
                    <p>At Compass Counseling, we guide you through these misconceptions and toward your proper road
                        forward. We will walk you through the application process, assist you in creating a balanced
                        college list, and show you how to highlight your special qualities to universities.</p>
